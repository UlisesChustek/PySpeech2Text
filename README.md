# Speech Recognition and Text-to-Speech Program

This program uses the `speech_recognition` and `pyttsx3` modules to recognize spoken text and convert it to text, and to synthesize speech from text.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3
- `speech_recognition` module
- `pyttsx3` module

## Usage

To run the program, open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where the script is located, and enter the following command:

    python speech_recognition_and_tts.py

The program will start listening for spoken input from the microphone. When it recognizes spoken text, it will print the text to the console and synthesize speech from the text.

## Notes

- This program only works in English.
- The `pyttsx3` module requires that you have a text-to-speech engine installed on your system. If you do not have one installed, the program will not be able to synthesize speech.
